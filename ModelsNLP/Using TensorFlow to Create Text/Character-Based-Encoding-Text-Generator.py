# Text data
data = """
In the town of Athy one Jeremy Lanigan
Battered away till he hadn't a pound.
His father died and made him a man again
Left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
He gave a grand party for friends and relations
Who didn't forget him when come to the wall,
And if you'll but listen I'll make your eyes glisten
Of the rows and the ructions of Laniganâ€™s Ball.
Myself to be sure got free invitation,
For all the nice girls and boys I might ask,
And just in a minute both friends and relations
Were dancing round merry as bees round a cask.
Judy O'Daly, that nice little milliner,
She tipped me a wink for to give her a call,
And I soon arrived with Peggy McGilligan
Just in time for Lanigan's Ball.
