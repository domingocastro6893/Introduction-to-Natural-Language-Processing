# Introduction-to-Natural-Language-Processing

Text can be far more difficult to work with. It’s often unstructured, can contain undesirable content such as formatting instructions, 
doesn’t always contain what you want, and often has to be filtered to remove nonsensical or irrelevant content.
In this chapter you saw how to take text and convert it to numbers using word tokenization, and then explored how to read and filter text in a variety of formats. 
Given these skills, you’re now ready to take the next step and learn how meaning can be inferred from words—the first step in understanding natural language.

# Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction
This project explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for preprocessing and analyzing text data. The topics covered include tokenization, padding, stopwords removal, and working with different data sources such as CSV and JSON files.

## Topics Covered

### Encoding Language into Numbers
An overview of how text data can be transformed into numerical representations for machine learning models.

### Getting Started with Tokenization
Introduction to tokenization, which is the process of converting text into tokens (words or subwords).

### Turning Sentences into Sequences
Explanation of how to convert sentences into sequences of tokens and prepare them for further processing.

### Using Out-of-Vocabulary Tokens
Discussion on handling words that are not in the training vocabulary by using out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens.

### Understanding Padding
Introduction to padding sequences to ensure they have a uniform length for input into machine learning models.

### Removing Stopwords and Cleaning Text
Techniques for removing common words (stopwords) and cleaning text data by removing unwanted characters and formatting.

### Working with Real Data Sources
Guidelines for obtaining and working with real-world text data from various sources.

### Getting Text from TensorFlow Datasets
Instructions on how to load and preprocess text data from TensorFlow Datasets.

### Using the IMDb Subwords Dataset
An example of working with the IMDb dataset, which contains movie reviews for sentiment analysis.

### Getting Text from CSV Files
Steps to read and preprocess text data stored in CSV files.

### Creating Training and Test Subsets
Methods for splitting your data into training and test sets for model evaluation.

### Getting Text from JSON Files
How to read and preprocess text data stored in JSON files.

### Reading JSON Files
A practical example of reading JSON files and extracting relevant information for analysis.
